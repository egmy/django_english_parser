# django_english_parser
Django web application that parses english grammar from a sentence or text file.
The application has a login authentication request linked to sql. If the user is not authenticated, they can create a new login/password. 
The user can then put in a simple sentence or sentences, or text file, and Django will break down the sentences into singular sentences and parts of speech, displaying a graph for each.
